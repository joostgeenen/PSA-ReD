# PSA-ReD
# An R script for generating PSA-ReD plots. 
# Built using R 3.5.2

Required software: 
- R
- RStudio

Tutorial: 
- Download the PSA ReD script - v1.0.1.R AND the PSA ReD project - v1.0.1.Rproj
- Make sure that they are in the same folder, preferably a dedicated folder (ie, not the generic 'download' folder)
- Open PSA-ReD project - v1.0.1.Rproj
- Open PSA-ReD script - v1.0.1.R

Now, the script is opened in RStudio and ready to use. 
- Information on using the script is provided in the following places:
    - In the peer-reviewed publication, available at: <link to paper>.
    - In the script, we provide step-by step guidance on how to use it. 
- Lines 1 to 362 should be ran without user input. From line 362, we provide guidance on what user input is required. 
- Parts inbetween "Do not change the part in between / below" and  "Do not change the part in between / above" should not be altered by the user, the should simply be ran. 
- Datafiles should be stored in the same folder as ReD project - v1.0.1.Rproj and PSA ReD script - v1.0.1.R.
- The PSA ReD images will automatically be saved in this same folder. 

We also provide an example datafile and a script that is ready to use with this datafile. This script is setup so that it generates Figure 2b from the publication. Runtime
